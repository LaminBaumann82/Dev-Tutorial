# Dev Tutorials
## This project is in progress... 

This will be a collection of useful information for C# and Blazor developers who have just started their journey or need a bit of a refresher on the topic.

 
## Getting started

If you start from scratch i suggest to beginn with the [SetUpVisualStudio](SetUpVisualStudio.md) Tutorial.

In case you already have a running instance of Visual Studio and want to start with C# basics go to [C# Advanced](C#Advanced.md)
